# Code

This folder contains the code for the proposed methodology together with some auxiliary analysis code. Next we list the scripts for the different [steps of the pipeline](../architecture.pdf):

* Profit Analysis Data Collection
	- [pool_api_client.py](pool_api_client.py). Use this to query Monero pools
	- [pool_api_client_bitcoin.py](pool_api_client_bitcoin.py). Use this to query Bitcoin pools


* Malware Data Collection and Extraction:
	- [malwareFeedCrawler.py](malwareFeedCrawler.py). Use this to crawl malware from public feeds ([vxVault](http://vxvault.net) and [Malc0de](http://malc0de.com/database/))
	- [VirusTotal/crawl_reports.py](VirusTotal/crawl_reports.py). Use this to get feeds from VirusTotal (requires Intelligence API)
	- [HybridAnalysis/queryManager.py](HybridAnalysis/queryManager.py). Use this to get feeds from HybridAnalyis (requires private API)
	- [virusTotalAnalyzer.py](virusTotalAnalyzer.py). Use this to process the data obtained from VirusTotal
	- [extractData.py](extractData.py). Use this to extract the data from the various feeds

* General Analysis:
	- [walletAnalyser.py](walletAnalyser.py). General routines to analyse wallets and samples
	- [domainAnalyser.py](domainAnalyser.py). General routines to analyse domains (including those obtained from OSINT sources)

* Aggregation:
	- [search4childs.py](search4childs.py). Auxiliary script to analyse relationships between samples
	- [mergeWallets.py](mergeWallets.py). Use this to aggregate into campaigns based on the data. Also include some auxiliary functions for analysis
